* Check all ReadPacket rate generation (like in RTL)
* Notify HW LO changed due to freq rounding in RTL? (generic check in ExtIO_USRP)

* Use real_rate or rounded? Chipmunks at fractional?

* m_hStopEvent - manual reset (checks in ReadPacket & ThreadProc - probably only rtl code)
* Set preferred device configution defaults in each CTOR

* Stop must stop (cannot fail, i.e. Remote must not deadlock)
* Abort sync I/O button
* Check SetGain against gainRange if (dev) && (min != max != 0)
* Set button for new relay address/xmlrpc port
* XMLRPC in different thread so doesn't block if can't connect

- Connection failure, but msgbox is modeless, can click 'Create' again and screw things up
- Freq offset
- WaitCursor for connect (or dialog)
- SHIFT to avoid connect
- Merge legacy reg settings
- Optional w/o hint
- Start/end flag
- virtual Config baseclass

* libusrp PCH
* BF_STREAM_END can't easily be integrated (or send empty packet)
